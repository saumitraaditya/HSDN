1. implement broadcast on the social layer.
2. implemented has to be tested.


steps in implementing a task environment:
1. initiator sends a resource solicitation request.
2. peers respond with a solicitation response.
3. initiator compiles all that information into an in-memory graph
4. network policy template: how to figure out instructions for setting up a  network from this compiled information.
5. simple policy:
a. 3 layer hierarchial network.
b. lowest layer are the leaf nodes comprised only of camera nodes.
c. then we have compute nodes, for this policy we have only one root node aggregator.
d. evenly distribute workload between layer 2 compute nodes, simple policy divide the number of available camera nodes
by the number of compute nodes in layer 2, then connect them evenly .


side idea: can I generate a class from a json configuration file and override methods to implement behavior.
